# Redweevil Detection Using Raspberry Pi

[![GitHub Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-techieRahul17%2FRedweevil__Detection__Using__Raspberry__Pi-blue)](https://github.com/techieRahul17/Redweevil_Detection_Using_Raspberry_Pi)

## Overview

**Redweevil Detection Using Raspberry Pi** is a cross-platform application intended to aid in detecting red weevils, leveraging the power of the Raspberry Pi and Flutter for UI. The application is designed as a starting point for building and deploying red weevil detection solutions, potentially integrating image processing, machine learning, or IoT features for smart agriculture.

> **Note:** This repository currently includes boilerplate code for a Flutter application. Project-specific detection logic and Raspberry Pi integration may need to be implemented.

## Features

- Cross-platform support (Linux, Windows, Web, etc. via Flutter)
- A modular codebase for rapid prototyping
- Ready for integration with Raspberry Pi hardware and sensors
- Boilerplate setup for C++ backend and native plugin support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- Raspberry Pi hardware (for deployment, optional at development stage)
- C++ Compiler for native builds (GCC for Linux, MSVC for Windows)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/techieRahul17/Redweevil_Detection_Using_Raspberry_Pi.git
    cd Redweevil_Detection_Using_Raspberry_Pi/redweevildetecttion
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Run the app**
    - For web:
      ```bash
      flutter run -d chrome
      ```
    - For desktop (Linux/Windows):
      ```bash
      flutter run -d linux   # or -d windows
      ```
